# MAH-Random-Password-Generator-HW3
GT Full-stack Web Development Program HW3

This repository contains the code to generate a random password based on user selected criteria. Using the event listener method on the browser's button object, the user is given a series of propmpts that save the users selection upon answering. The user is asked for a desired password length (between 8 and 128 characters), and the character types the user prefers to be used in the generated password (upper case, lower case, numbers, and special characters).
